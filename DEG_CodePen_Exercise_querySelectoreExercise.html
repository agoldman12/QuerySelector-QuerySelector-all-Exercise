				Below we have an array of song lyrics. Each item in the array represents a line in the song.

				Goal: Learn to use the .querySelector() and .querySelectorAll methods

				Task: Using querySelector, insert the song title into the corresponding element. Using querySelectorAll, insert each lyric line into its corresponding element.
